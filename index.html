										<h2>Beth Keller Coaching</h2>
										<p>Everyone deserves a coach.</p>
									</header>
									<p>A brand-new teacher in 2006, my original training and first love was - and still is - Middle School. 
									The best stuff is in the middle and you will never convince me otherwise. Leaving the classroom was a tough decision, but in 2018 the opportunity to increase of my impact as an instructional coach coaxed me out of my corner classroom.</p>
									<p>As a coach, I quickly realized the majority of people already know what to do. They already have the answers. They already know the next right step. More often than not, they didn't need a new tool or a list of resources. Most educators (at ALL levels) just needed space - to think, consider, process, decide - a space to be heard, to reflect, to leave feeling encouraged and empowered.</p> 
									<b><i>I learned that a good coach creates and holds space for connection, curiosity, and growth.</i></b></p>
									
									<p>I was hooked. I've been coaching - and being coached - ever since. I firmly believe in the power of coaching. I believe that every team, program, and leader can benefit from space to focus on their strengths, to ask thoughtful questions, and to encourage continual growth. </p>
									<p> I have a coach. I think everyone deserves a coach. I would love for you to have one too.</p>
